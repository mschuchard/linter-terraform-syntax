### Linter-Terraform-Syntax
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mschuchard/linter-terraform-syntax.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mschuchard/linter-terraform-syntax)

Linter-Terraform-Syntax aims to provide functional and robust `terraform validate` and `plan` linting and `fmt` formatting functionality within Atom.

### Installation
Terraform >= 0.11 is required to be installed before using this. The Linter and Language-Terraform Atom packages are also required.

**Notice** This (1.4.1) is the final version that will support Terraform < 0.12.

### Usage
- In the package settings there is an option to use `terraform plan` instead of `terraform validate`. Both options will show syntax errors for files in the current directory and notify non-syntax validation errors for the current directory. The plan option will additionally notify non-syntax plan errors for the current directory, but it will take longer to execute. As of Terraform version 0.10, `terraform validate` now catches many more issues that it previously missed and `terraform plan` found.
- To quickly and easily access issues in other files, you will need to change the settings inside Linter-UI-Default. For `Panel Represents` and/or `Statusbar Represents`, you will need to change their options to `Entire Project`. This will allow you to use either display to quickly access issues in other files by clicking on the displayed information. Note this will not work on directory issues since a directory cannot be opened in a pane.
- Terraform >= 0.12 is fully supported. Although your version will be auto-detected by this package, you should verify the config setting for it yourself. This is especially true if you switch Terraform versions without reloading Atom. Note that only `validate` linting functionality changes in >= 0.12. Note also that config settings related to variables are ignored in Terraform >= 0.12 `validate`.
- There is a bug for some providers (e.g. Digital Ocean) where disabling Check Required Variables (only relevant for 0.11 `validate`) will disable ALL validation checks. Please be aware of this and upgrade or switch to `plan` accordingly.
